# 🛍️ Shop Inventory Manager (Java + SQLite)

A simple Java-based inventory management system designed to help small shopkeepers manage products based on shelf location (row × column), update stock, and generate bills — all stored locally using a lightweight SQLite database.

## 📖 About the Project

This project idea came from a real-life scenario when one of my friends asked me to create software for his newly opened shop. He said:

> "We have opened a new shop with more than 120 shelves. It's getting hard to manage the products properly. Can you build something simple for us?"

He requested a solution that met the following needs:

- ❌ Does not require internet
- 💾 Stores data locally in a `.db` file
- 🔍 Allows product access using shelf positions (Row × Column)
- 🖥 Can be converted into a `.exe` file for non-technical users

That conversation inspired me to build this offline, Java-based inventory management system.
